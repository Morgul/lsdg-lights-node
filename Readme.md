I'll write something here later.

## Installation

Right, so I'm using audiolib.js, which while super nice... kinda has a crappy dependency. So, before doing anything,
you must install `cubeb`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kinetiknz/cubeb
$ cd cubeb
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
```

Now you can go about your business.
